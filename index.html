  <h1> Web Exercise 1: GitHub Website </h1>
  <p> Hello, and welcome to mbecchio1's BDA594 Web1 exercise! <p><p>
  <p><b> Datasets of Interest from 
    <a href="https://github.com/academic/awesome-datascience">awesome-datascience</a> github: </b>
<p>    The data set of interest that I chose ultmately came from a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>  inventory which held a data set 
  describing <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries">data science job salaries.</a> This data set contains features/variables
  including: <i> work_year, experience_level, job_title, salary, company_size, company_location </i> etc. 'Data science jobs'
  encompass a very large field with a lot niches and varying responsabilities. This data set is 
  relevant to our class, just as well for anyone looking into the different avenues of data science. The relative compensation will grant a decent
  window into the financial endowments that accompany a data science opportunity of a particular profession, applicant type, relative experience, regional selectivity, etc.
